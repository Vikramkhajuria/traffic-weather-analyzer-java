  # Traffic & Weather Bottleneck Analyzer  
  ---

  ### Overview  
  A Java console application that analyzes simplified weather and traffic conditions for predefined locations and determines a bottleneck risk level: **LOW**, **MEDIUM**, or **HIGH**.  
  The project focuses on clean Object-Oriented Programming, multi-class structure, and modular design without using real APIs.

  ### Purpose  
  - Practice real-world OOP fundamentals  
  - Learn multi-class system design  
  - Strengthen logical thinking and clean code patterns  
  - Build a complete project through structured phases  

  ---

  ### Features  
  - Predefined locations  
  - Weather data (temperature + condition)  
  - Traffic data (congestion level)  
  - Risk analysis logic returning LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH  
  - Separation of concerns across classes  
  - Extendable system suitable for datasets or APIs

### Development Phases  
**Phase 1 — Data Model (Completed)**  
Created Location, WeatherInfo, and TrafficInfo classes.

**Phase 2 — TrafficAnalyzer Logic (Completed)**  
Implemented risk evaluation based on weather and congestion.

**Phase 3 — FakeDataService (Upcoming)**  
Provide predefined weather and traffic data.

**Phase 4 — Console Menu System (Upcoming)**  
Interactive menu for user-selected locations.

**Phase 5 — Enhancements (Future)**  
Gradle support, datasets, UML diagrams, real API integration.

### What I Learned  
- Multi-class Java design  
- Encapsulation and constructors  
- Domain modeling (location, weather, traffic)  
- Implementing logical decision rules  
- Testing behavior before UI  
- Using Git and GitHub professionally  

---

### Tech Used  
- Java  
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### Next Steps  
- Implement FakeDataService  
- Replace hardcoded test objects  
- Build full console menu  
- Add dataset support (CSV/JSON)  
- Convert to Gradle  
- Add UML diagrams  

---

### Future Vision  
- Real weather/traffic API integration  
- More advanced risk scoring  
- UI version (JavaFX or web)  
- Automated tests  
- Modular Gradle setup
